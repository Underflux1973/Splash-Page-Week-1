WEEK 1 - PROJECT REVIST

Now that I have finished my Skills Bootcamp I have time to revisit the course material and projects in the hope that I can embed some of the knowlege further. Its interesting visiting this project as it was the first assignment we were given - it seems like such a long time ago, but it was only four months ago. Looking at this now, it feels very basic, but from the point of view of accomplishment and feelings of resolution I felt it was important to revisit this one.

This is a basic static webpage using HTML and CSS. I am actually quite happy with the structure of most of my code. The problems I encountered with the original project were very basic errors concerning file path names as the images didn't load up when I shared the link to the web page as the filepath was incorrect, which I have now fixed.

As a developer you will always want to work smarter and use the minimum amount of code to fulfill the function and design of the web app/page. I can see that I have used duplicate code. I will endeavour to look at simplifying this further.

I am also keen to have a look at advanced flexbox design and css grids to see if I can simplify this even further. To be honest I feel that a lot of this will be null and void depending on how much I decide to use Next JS and React, as there are some excellent tools that simplify e.g. Tailwind (a newish CSS inline design code that is pretty nifty) and Daisy UI (a component library that could be used for this front-end led project).
